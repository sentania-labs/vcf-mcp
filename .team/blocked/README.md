# BLOCKED markers

A resident that genuinely cannot proceed writes a marker here, then ends its
turn. This is the one sanctioned way to end a turn without shipping the
artifact it was dispatched to ship.

It exists because of a specific failure mode: a session ending on "next I
will build X" rather than on X. That is not a blocked session, it is an
unfinished one, and from the outside the two are indistinguishable until
someone goes looking. A marker makes the difference legible, and puts the
thing needed in writing where the next run can act on it.

The bar is high. Before writing one, confirm all three:

1. The resident cannot answer the question itself. A question answerable by
   reading the repo is not a blocker, it is a task.
2. The resident cannot make a reversible decision and proceed. If a wrong
   guess costs a commit that is cheap to revert, guess, proceed, and say what
   was guessed.
3. The input needed genuinely comes from outside the resident: an escalation
   to the human principal, a peer's sign-off, an unresolved deadlock, a
   credential the resident does not have.

Not a blocker: work that is hard, work that is large, work that could be
scoped down instead. Scope it down, ship the smaller thing, and say what was
cut.

## Filename pattern

    .team/blocked/<resident>-<UTC-timestamp>.md

- `<resident>`: `orchestrator`, `claude-worker`, `codex-worker`, `agy-worker`,
  or `critic` (this project's seated cursor critic).
- `<UTC-timestamp>`: ISO 8601 basic form, `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`. Basic form
  because colons in filenames are not cross-platform-clean; use this form
  regardless of this project's actual target platforms, since it costs
  nothing and avoids a class of filesystem problems outright.

Example: `.team/blocked/claude-worker-20260716T142205Z.md`

Timestamped rather than overwritten: a resident can block twice on the same
assignment for different reasons, and the sequence of what blocked when is
worth more than the latest entry alone.

## Required contents

```markdown
---
resident: claude-worker
assignment: <one-line assignment summary>
phase: phase 1 blind proposal
branch: claude/<assignment-slug>
timestamp: 2026-07-16T14:22:05Z
blocked_on: principal | orchestrator | peer-resident | external

## What I need

One sentence, specific enough to act on. "The API rate limit" is not
actionable. "Whether the rate limit is per-user or per-key, since
ARCHITECTURE.md does not say and the answer changes the whole caching layer"
is.

## What I tried first

What was read, what was ruled out, and why the answer is not derivable from
the repo. This is what stops a marker from being a question someone else has
to research from scratch.

## What is done and committed

The commits that exist despite the block. A block is not permission to leave
partial work uncommitted: commit what exists on your local branch (never
push it, see below) and cite the SHA here.

## What unblocks me

The specific decision or input, and who can give it.
```

Note `timestamp` appears in both the filename and the front matter. The
filename form is basic (no colons, cross-platform-clean), the front matter
form is the readable one. They record the same instant.

## Where to put it, given worktree isolation

A worker works in its own worktree on its own branch. Committing a marker
there and stopping puts the marker on that branch and nowhere else, so the
orchestrator, reading its own checkout of `main`, sees nothing. The recovery
signal would be invisible in exactly the situation it exists for.

So a blocked worker does both of these, in order:

1. **Commit the marker on your own branch (never pushed)**, alongside whatever
   work exists. Do not leave it uncommitted in a worktree nobody else will ever
   check out. Doer seats never run `git push`; the orchestrator provisions your
   worktree and shares its object store, so a committed marker is visible to it
   on the local branch ref without a push.
2. **Report the block to the orchestrator in your dispatch output**: branch,
   marker path, and the one-sentence version of what is needed. The marker is
   the detail; this is the ping. A marker nobody is told about is a message
   in a bottle.

The orchestrator, on its next run, does not rely on step 2 having landed. It
enumerates the resident branches for markers under `.team/blocked/` that are
not on `main`:

    git fetch --all --quiet
    git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/<branch> -- .team/blocked/

A worker can die between committing the marker and reporting it, and that is
one of the likelier ways for a run to end. The scan is what makes the marker
findable anyway.

When the orchestrator acts on a marker, it cherry-picks or re-commits it onto
`main` so the block is visible in one place, and records the pointer in
`TEAM-STATE.md`. The orchestrator's own markers go straight onto `main`,
since it has no feature branch of its own.

## Who reads these

The orchestrator, on its next run. It reads `TEAM-STATE.md` first, which
should name the block under "Phase" (the resident blocking the phase) or
"Open escalations" if it went up to the human principal. This directory holds
the detail; `TEAM-STATE.md` holds the pointer.

A read-only critic seat (if this project has one) cannot write here, so a
blocked critic says BLOCKED in its output with the same contents, and the
orchestrator writes the marker on its behalf.

Resolved markers stay. Like decision records, the history of what blocked the
team is worth keeping: multiple markers naming the same missing input is a
fact about the framework, not about the resident that hit it.

"""Consensus gate: PRs touching protected paths need a signed decision record.

Layer 3 of the review architecture (see docs/decisions/README.md). If a PR
touches any path enumerated in .github/protected-paths.txt, it must reference a
docs/decisions/NNN-topic.md record carrying a sign-off line from every worker
that record says was dispatched for it. The record names its own worker set, so
a two-worker round and a three-worker round are both checkable without this
file knowing which residents are seated.

A reference counts if either:
  - the PR body mentions the record path, or
  - the PR diff adds or modifies that record file (the normal case: the record
    usually lands in the same PR as the change it governs).

Stdlib only, no project-specific engine, no network. Deliberately cheap enough to run on every
PR without caring about it.

Usage:
    tools/check_consensus.py --changed-files changed.txt --pr-body body.txt
    tools/check_consensus.py --changed-files changed.txt          # no body
    tools/check_consensus.py --self-test

--changed-files takes a file with one repo-relative path per line (what
`git diff --name-only` emits). Exit 0 = pass, 1 = gate failed, 2 = bad usage.
